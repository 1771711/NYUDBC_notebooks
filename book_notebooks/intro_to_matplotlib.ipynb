    "We will start with basic concepts and techinical components in graphs. Then I organize the majority of this lecture around the question **How does GDP and it's expenditure componenets co-move?** I'll set it up like a mini-project...we will practice previous skills to downlad and manipulate the data, then we will learn about ploting the data (and doing so in a way to explore how GDP and its expenditure componenets move). \n",

    "So why do call it as an **abstraction**? For almost every graph, there is a loss of data (often not so important ones in current setting), because it is impossible for human beings to absorb all the numbers, strings at once. We often use different physical attributes of vision (length, position, size, shape, and color, etc) to make the transformation of data. \n",

    "Thus sometimes, the instentions of visualisation designers may directly have impacts on what we perceive/understand about the data. Also, sometimes even a design decision can motivate omission of important data. So we will keep this in mind either from the perspective of a reader or designer. Please see the following intuitive example.   \n"
